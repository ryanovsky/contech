<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We are going to implement a backend application for Contech that will simulate the MESI protocol with a variable number of cores in a processor, as well as transactional memory using the lazy optimistic scheme. We will then use our simulation to measure bus traffic and contention, as well as transactional memory commits and aborts.</p>

<h3>
<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h3>

<p>This schedule is not complete. We will talk to Professor Railing on Tuesday at 3, to discuss goals and objectives.  Updates will come after
April 4-10: Contech Research and basic MSI for quad-core
April 11-17: Implemented MESI
April 18-24: Implement Transactional Memory</p>

<a id="completed-work-so-far" class="anchor" href="#completed-work-so-far" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Completed work so far</h3>

<p>We have learned how to use Contech.  Initially, our simulation traverses a contech TaskGraph and orders the memory requests based on when they would be completed.  We then begin simulating the MESI protocol, by sending requests to the bus, which updates the state of all the caches.  Once the bus returns, then the given memory request can be put in the owners cache.  As of now, we arbitrarily chose how many clock cycles each event will take.  These events include a memory flush, memory load, and L1 cache hit.</p>

<p>We are half way done, and in a good spot for our deliverables. We just have to add a second part to our project (will be figured out after meeting with Railing, either transactional memory or split-transaction bus).</p>

<p>We do not expect to come across any unknown challenges, we believe it is just a matter of coding.  However, unexpected challenges may always arrive.</p>

<h3>
<a id="results" class="anchor" href="#results" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h3>

<p>Our results will be a couple of graphs and analysis, of hits and misses over time created from different Contech TaskGraphs. </p>

<p>Contech is a compiler-based (specifically <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>) instrumentation, designed to efficiently record the execution trace, memory accesses, and parallel interactions of a program.  The instrumentation has been tested across programs written in C, C++, and Fortran, as well as those using pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI.</p>

<p>Contech is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/bprail/contech/wiki/Contech">wiki</a>.</p>
