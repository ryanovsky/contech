We will then use our simulation to measure bus traffic and contention.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nApril 4-10: Contech Research and basic MSI for quad-core\r\nApril 11-17: Implement MESI\r\nApril 18-20: Change the ordering that memory goes to the bus\r\nApril 21-26: Split transaction\r\nApril 27 - May 2: Implement a ring interconnect \r\nMay 3- 9: Create a presentation, do analysis, compare the ring to the split transaction memory bus\r\n\r\n### Completed work so far\r\nWe have learned how to use Contech.  Initially, our simulation traverses a contech TaskGraph and orders the memory requests based on when they would be completed.  We then begin simulating the MESI protocol, by sending requests to the bus, which updates the state of all the caches.  Once the bus returns, then the given memory request can be put in the owners cache.  As of now, we arbitrarily chose how many clock cycles each event will take.  These events include a memory flush, memory load, and L1 cache hit.\r\n\r\nWe still have a lot of work that needs to be done.  First we have to reorder the way that memory is sent to the bus.  We have to implement a split transaction bus, and then look into creating a ring bus as well.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect to come across any unknown challenges, but we still have to look into a ring bus in more detail, we believe it is just a matter of coding.  After we finish implementing the split transaction bus, we may choose to not do the ring bus but instead do directory based cache coherence (we do not want to lock ourselves into the ring idea).\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nOur results will be a set of graphs and analysis, of hits and misses over time created from different Contech TaskGraphs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### General Contech info\r\nContech is a compiler-based (specifically [LLVM](http://llvm.org)) instrumentation, designed to efficiently record the execution trace, memory accesses, and parallel interactions of a program.  The instrumentation has been tested across programs written in C, C++, and Fortran, as well as those using pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI.\r\n\r\nContech is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/bprail/contech/wiki/Contech).\r\n\r\nAuthors and Contributors\r\n@bprail is the software architect of this project.  Contributions have also been made by @ehein6.  Additional components have been provided by @caparrov.\r\n\r\nPublication\r\nContech has appeared in the journal, [ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2776893).\r\n\r\nContech appeared as a tutorial at [IISWC 2015](http://www.iiswc.org/iiswc2015/index.html).\r\n",
