  "body": "### Summary\r\nWe are going to implement a backend application for Contech that will simulate the MESI protocol with a variable number of cores in a processor, as well as transactional memory using the lazy optimistic scheme. We will then use our simulation to measure bus traffic and contention, as well as transactional memory commits and aborts.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nThis schedule is not complete. We will talk to Professor Railing on Tuesday at 3, to discuss goals and objectives.  Updates will come after\r\nApril 4-10: Contech Research and basic MSI for quad-core\r\nApril 11-17: Implemented MESI\r\nApril 18-24: Implement Transactional Memory\r\n\r\n### Completed work so far\r\nWe have learned how to use Contech.  Initially, our simulation traverses a contech TaskGraph and orders the memory requests based on when they would be completed.  We then begin simulating the MESI protocol, by sending requests to the bus, which updates the state of all the caches.  Once the bus returns, then the given memory request can be put in the owners cache.  As of now, we arbitrarily chose how many clock cycles each event will take.  These events include a memory flush, memory load, and L1 cache hit.\r\n\r\nWe are half way done, and in a good spot for our deliverables. We just have to add a second part to our project (will be figured out after meeting with Railing, either transactional memory or split-transaction bus).\r\n\r\nWe do not expect to come across any unknown challenges, we believe it is just a matter of coding.  However, unexpected challenges may always arrive.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nOur results will be a couple of graphs and analysis, of hits and misses over time created from different Contech TaskGraphs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### General Contech info\r\nContech is a compiler-based (specifically [LLVM](http://llvm.org)) instrumentation, designed to efficiently record the execution trace, memory accesses, and parallel interactions of a program.  The instrumentation has been tested across programs written in C, C++, and Fortran, as well as those using pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI.\r\n\r\nContech is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/bprail/contech/wiki/Contech).\r\n\r\nAuthors and Contributors\r\n@bprail is the software architect of this project.  Contributions have also been made by @ehein6.  Additional components have been provided by @caparrov.\r\n\r\nPublication\r\nContech has appeared in the journal, [ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2776893).\r\n\r\nContech appeared as a tutorial at [IISWC 2015](http://www.iiswc.org/iiswc2015/index.html).\r\n",
