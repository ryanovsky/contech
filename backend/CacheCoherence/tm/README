This is a MESI cache coherence simulator with a split transaction bus interconnect using lazy-optimistic transactional memory.

To compile, use the Makefile.
To run:
./ccache <size of cache, log2> <input file>
Our simulation only supports cache sizes greater than 7.
A simple input file was provided - input.txt.

Input files should be formatted as:
<processor num>: <transaction command> <address>

transaction commands can be Xbegin, load, store, and Xcommit.
